# What is a command shell?

A command shell is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer, also known as a
Read-Eval-Print Loop ([REPL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)).

A shell takes input from the keyboard, evaluates that input, and executes the input as a shell
command gives the input to the operating system to executed. Most shells can also read commands from
a file, called a script, may include programming features like variables, flow control, and
functions.
